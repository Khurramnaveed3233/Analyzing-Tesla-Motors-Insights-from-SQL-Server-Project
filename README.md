# 📘 About the Project

In this **SQL-powered Business Intelligence project**, I explored **Tesla Motors’ key operational areas** using structured data from five critical domains:

- Sales  
- Inventory  
- Customer Feedback  
- Service Records  
- Vehicles  

The objective was to convert raw relational data into **actionable business insights** that support Tesla's leadership in **data-driven strategic decisions**.

## ❓ Problem Statement

Tesla operates in a **fast-paced, tech-driven automotive industry** where efficiency and customer experience are key to maintaining a competitive edge.

**Key challenges include:**

- Uncovering top-performing models and peak sales periods  
- Understanding customer satisfaction trends  
- Optimizing inventory to avoid overstocking or stockouts  
- Reducing service-related customer dissatisfaction  

Without insight-driven solutions, Tesla risks **operational inefficiencies** and **missed business opportunities**.

## 📈 Key Insights & Recommendations

### 🔥 Sales Trends
- **Insight:** Model X had the highest sales volume over the past year  
  **Recommendation:** Increase production and marketing investment for Model X to maximize profitability

- **Insight:** Peak sales occurred in Q2 and Q4  
  **Recommendation:** Launch promotional campaigns and scale inventory during these quarters

### 🧠 Customer Feedback
- **Insight:** Models with higher service frequency received lower customer ratings  
  **Recommendation:** Reassess design and durability of low-rated models and provide targeted support

- **Insight:** Common themes included service delays and limited charging stations  
  **Recommendation:** Expand fast-charging infrastructure and streamline service workflows

### 📦 Inventory Optimization
- **Insight:** High-demand models experienced frequent stockouts  
  **Recommendation:** Use historical sales data to align production with demand forecasts

- **Insight:** Inventory levels varied inefficiently across locations  
  **Recommendation:** Implement a regional, demand-based stocking strategy

### 🛠️ Service Operations
- **Insight:** Battery issues and software bugs were the most frequent complaints  
  **Recommendation:** Implement predictive maintenance alerts and enhance OTA (over-the-air) update capabilities

- **Insight:** Models with frequent service needs contributed to customer churn  
  **Recommendation:** Launch product quality audits for high-maintenance models to identify root causes
