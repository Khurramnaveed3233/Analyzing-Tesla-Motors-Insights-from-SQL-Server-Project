#  📌 Project Overview

In this SQL-driven data analysis project, I examined key operational challenges and business insights at Tesla Motors using structured data from their sales, inventory, service, and customer feedback domains. The project focuses on transforming raw business data into actionable insights that can aid decision-making for Tesla’s executive and operational teams.

This project demonstrates my ability to:

  - Perform multi-domain analysis (Sales, Feedback, Inventory, Service)

  - Write efficient SQL queries in SQL Server

  - Uncover trends, correlations, and performance gaps

  - Translate data into business value

#  🗃️ Data Domains Analyzed

  - Orders – Vehicle sales data

  - Vehicles – Product catalog

  - Inventory – Stock availability

  - CustomerFeedback – Ratings and text reviews

  - ServiceRecords – Vehicle servicing data
