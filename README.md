## 📘 About the Project

In this **SQL-driven data analysis project**, I explored key operational challenges and business opportunities within **Tesla Motors** using structured data from five major domains: **Sales, Inventory, Customer Feedback, Service Records**, and **Vehicles**.

The goal was to turn raw business data into **actionable insights** that help Tesla’s leadership make **smarter, data-backed decisions**.

### 👨‍💻 Skills Demonstrated

- Multi-domain business analysis (Sales, Feedback, Inventory, Service)
- Writing optimized SQL queries in SQL Server
- Identifying trends, correlations, and bottlenecks
- Translating technical findings into business strategy

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Tesla operates in a fast-paced, competitive auto-tech environment. Efficiently managing **sales**, **inventory**, **customer sentiment**, and **after-sales service** is vital to remain competitive.

Without proper data analysis, Tesla risks:

- Overlooking key sales patterns and seasonal trends  
- Letting customer dissatisfaction go unresolved  
- Mismanaging vehicle inventory leading to stockouts  
- Escalating service costs with no strategic response

## ✅ Business Problems Solved with SQL

### 🔥 Sales Performance
- Identified **top-selling vehicle models**
- Revealed **seasonal sales patterns** for forecasting

### 🧠 Customer Feedback
- Calculated **average ratings per model**
- Extracted **themes from customer comments**
- Determined **feedback participation rates**

### 📦 Inventory Management
- Analyzed **inventory levels** by vehicle model
- Examined **correlation between inventory and sales**

### 🛠️ Service Records
- Found **most common service issues**
- Identified **high-maintenance vehicle models**
- Assessed how **service frequency affects satisfaction**

# 📊 SQL Analysis Breakdown

---

## 🔥 1. Sales Performance Analysis

### 1.1 Which vehicle model has the highest sales volume?

```sql
SELECT TOP 1 
    v.VehicleID, 
    v.Model, 
    SUM(o.TotalAmount) AS highest_sales_volume
FROM Orders o
JOIN Vehicles v ON o.VehicleID = v.VehicleID
GROUP BY v.VehicleID, v.Model
ORDER BY highest_sales_volume DESC;


---

## 💡 Key Insights & Recommendations

### 🔥 Sales Trends
- **Insight**: Model X had the highest sales volume over the past year  
  **Recommendation**: Prioritize production and advertising for Model X

- **Insight**: Q2 and Q4 show peak seasonal demand  
  **Recommendation**: Align promotional campaigns and inventory stocking with these periods

---

### 🧠 Customer Feedback
- **Insight**: Average ratings differ significantly across models  
  **Recommendation**: Improve after-sales support for lower-rated models

- **Insight**: Text feedback indicates issues with **charging stations** and **service delays**  
  **Recommendation**: Apply **NLP techniques** to extract feedback themes at scale, and invest in station infrastructure

---

### 📦 Inventory Challenges
- **Insight**: High-demand vehicles often have low stock levels  
  **Recommendation**: Adjust production schedules to match model-specific sales patterns

- **Insight**: Inventory mismatch across geographic locations  
  **Recommendation**: Improve location-based demand forecasting using historical sales

---

### 🛠️ Service Operations
- **Insight**: Frequent service issues include **battery problems** and **software bugs**  
  **Recommendation**: Enhance predictive maintenance and push over-the-air (OTA) software updates

- **Insight**: High service frequency is linked to **lower customer satisfaction**  
  **Recommendation**: Audit high-service-frequency models to identify design flaws or recurring issues

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

| Tool        | Purpose                                       |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **SQL Server** | Data querying, joining, and aggregations      |
| **T-SQL**      | Advanced grouping, filtering, and time logic |
| **Excel**      | Initial data validation and summaries         |
| **PowerPoint** | Business report and presentation visuals      |
| *(Optional)* Power BI | Future integration for dashboards     |

---

## 🧩 Challenges Faced

- **Complex Joins**: Multiple tables and relationships required optimized joins  
- **Text Feedback**: Manual review of customer comments, future scope for automation with Python NLP  
- **Service Data**: Inconsistent service descriptions needed cleaning and categorization  
- **Missing Data**: Nulls and incomplete records were handled using filters and `LEFT JOIN` logic

---

## 📌 Conclusion

This project offers **deep operational insights** into Tesla’s core business areas. Using structured SQL logic, I transformed raw transactional data into a **strategic decision-making tool**.

✅ An excellent portfolio project to showcase:

- **Relational database querying**
- **Operational and business insight extraction**
- **SQL-based problem solving**
- **Real-world data interpretation**
